# HaloX

## BRANCH: ver/halo_v3.5.1


Added back in cellType code. Pulled code from CBJ
    https://github.com/caitlinjones/Halo_HodgkinsLymphoma

Changed loadHaloData to include %-complete columns

This code works with the new halo version (HALO v3.2.1851.354) which also
has the AI code in it. Note this version no longer seems to have the
Analysis Inputs column so parsing of the marker specific meta data is
completely different now

New Halo analysis scripts
